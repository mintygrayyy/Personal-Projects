The console will first give the user a list of commands that can be run. The user must first load
their image into the console by using "load filepath name". Once the image is loaded in, the user
can apply any filter onto it and the console will output if the filter has been successfully added.
All filters should be written in the format of "filter fileName newFileName" with the exception
of brighten and darken which should both contain integer values that show how much should be
brightened or darkened. The user can then save any of the images by using "save savedFilePath fileName".
The program can be closed by typing quit.
